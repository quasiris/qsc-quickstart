    "- **Important Note:** If your products have attributs like \"color\", \"wight\", \"width\", \"height\" etc. don't add them to the field you want to make searchable. Those are handeld seperate. The same goes for categories, if your dataset is categorized.<br>Due to this fact there are some special names you don't want to use as a key:<br>**Fields reserved by the qsc: \"attributes\" and \"categories\"**\n",

    "- At the end you will get a short summary. The most important part is the **API key feeding**. You need this key to feed data to your index, so copy it and save it somewhere safe. Don't worry if you lose this key you can display the key later in the web interface or generate a new one.\n",
